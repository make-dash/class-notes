### Sprint planning and pair programming
* Celebrate your wins (Something I really need to do)
* Conduct Sprint planning and retrospectives with your partner
* Clarify roles and ownership

### Common issues
* Hard to meetup
    * Bus/scoot/remote work
    * Same classes so we can meet whenever
    * Discord
* One person more technically advanced
    * Could always just demo something that it is we don't understand
    * Task delegation
* indecision on idea
    * Meeting halfway to find a shared vision
    * we're pretty set on doing one thing and then building around it
    * being flexible
* indecision on stack and tech
    * Limit the scope
    * Creating an `Area Owner` for tech - this person makes the final call on all tech used
    * what's the most logical and logistical solution to solve the problem we need
* indecision on design
    * Pick an `Area Owner` for UX/UI now - this person makes the final call on all things UX/UI 
    * Have one person handle the design, other person provide feedback
* lack of accountability and follow throught (one or both)
    * always checking in to make sure that no one is falling behind
    * setting goals/having standups to make sure that the team is on pace ot reach tasks
    * set small, gile goals
    * adhere to set deadlines
    * communicate
    * escalate problems early
    * Focus on fun
    * 1 retrospective per week, at least 2 standups per week.
