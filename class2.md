### User journey (pre conceived)
* (Teachers perspective) I wanted to know how many of my students got their work done. I logged into to make-board, I clicked on the specific class,
and from there I was able to see what % and # of students had completed my assignment.
* (TA) I wanted to see what students needed help with BEW. I logged into to make-board, I clicked on the BEW class section, and was able to see which
students had flagged that they needed help on assignments.
* (Student perspective) I wanted to put my repo on the tracker and mark that I completed the assignment. I clicked on the class section, 
inserted my repo, and checked off that I had completed the assignment.
